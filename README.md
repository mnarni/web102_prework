## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

One challenge I faced while building the app was transitioning back to pure JavaScript and CSS after relying on frameworks for a while. Adjusting to direct DOM manipulations and core styling without framework abstractions required revisiting fundamentals and adopting a more hands-on coding approach. Despite the initial challenges, this experience strengthened my foundational skills, fostering a deeper understanding of JavaScript and CSS and enhancing my adaptability in web development.
